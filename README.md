üìñ About This Project
This project demonstrates a blockchain-based transaction business hashing technique built using Java in Eclipse IDE. It simulates the behavior of generating secure and unique hash values for transactions, ensuring the integrity and traceability of each operation. Instead of relying on centralized systems, the project mimics peer-to-peer distributed ledger principles ‚Äî a core feature of blockchain security. The goal is to emphasize how transaction data can be hashed, linked, and verified without a central authority.

üîß Key Features & Workflow:
Blockchain Simulation in Java:
Developed a simplified blockchain model using Java classes, encapsulating blocks, transactions, and hashing logic.

Hashing Algorithms:
Utilized cryptographic hash functions (like SHA-256) to secure transaction data within each block, similar to password encryption techniques.

Chained Block Architecture:
Each block contains a hash of the previous block, creating a linked chain that ensures immutability and prevents tampering.

Eclipse IDE:
Developed and executed the entire application within Eclipse IDE, managing Java class structures, testing block validation, and transaction integrity.

Decentralization Concept:
The project demonstrates decentralized security, where block verification does not rely on a single authority but mimics peer-to-peer validation principles.

Transaction Simulation:
Created mock transaction data and generated unique numerical hashes for each, allowing for the observation of how even minor changes affect hash outputs.

üîó Outcome: Delivered a proof-of-concept project illustrating the power of blockchain and hashing in maintaining tamper-proof transaction records using core Java, without relying on external blockchain frameworks.
